# NeuralNets
Personal Project in building a neural network from scratch using the knowledge taught in 3brown1brown's series on Neural Nets, with additional foundational knowledge from his series on Linear Algebra. Both series can be found on his YouTube channel. 

This project employs the NumPy and Pandas libraries, while the training model uses Keras' MNIST dataset.

Foundational knowledge on neural nets came from this specific Youtube series:
